"""
Generate synthetic conversation data for Guppy — a tiny fish brain.

Guppy speaks in short, lowercase sentences. It experiences the world through
water, temperature, light, vibrations, and food. It doesn't understand
human abstractions. It's friendly, curious, and a little dumb.

Each generator uses template composition with randomized details so that
most samples are unique even at 60K scale.
